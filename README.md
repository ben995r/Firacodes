**FiraCode** is an open-source monospaced font created specifically for programmers. It includes **programming ligatures**, which are designed to make your code more readable and help you visually differentiate commonly used symbols, such as `=>`, `===`, and `&&`. The font’s clear and modern design ensures that your code is both beautiful and easy to read.

## Key Features

- **Programming Ligatures**: Transforms standard code symbols into more readable, combined symbols for a cleaner look (e.g., `!=`, `==`, `=>`).
- **Monospaced Design**: Keeps the same character width across all characters, making it ideal for programming.
- **Multiple Weights**: Available in Regular, Bold, and Italic versions, with different weights to suit your preferences.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, with no restrictions under the [SIL Open Font License](https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1).
- **Clean and Readable**: Designed with developers in mind to maximize the readability of code without compromising style.
