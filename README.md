FiraCode is an open-source monospaced font designed for programmers. It features programming ligatures that enhance code readability and help visually differentiate commonly used symbols. The font’s clear and modern design ensures that your code is both beautiful and easy to read.

## Key Features

- **Programming Ligatures**: FiraCode transforms standard code symbols into more readable, combined symbols for a cleaner look. For example:
  - `!=` becomes ≠
  - `==` becomes ≡
  - `=>` becomes ⇒
  
- **Monospaced Design**: The font maintains the same character width across all characters, making it ideal for programming tasks.

- **Multiple Weights**: FiraCode is available in Regular, Bold, and Italic versions, allowing you to choose the weight that best suits your coding style.

- **Open Source**: You can use FiraCode freely under the [SIL Open Font License](https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1). There are no restrictions on its use.

- **Clean and Readable**: The font is designed specifically for developers, maximizing the readability of code without compromising on style.
